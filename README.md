# AI Clinical Practice Guideline CSP-Model

A flexible data-driven approach to CPG implementation, where a CPG is cast as a constraint satisfaction model with constraints defining allowable variable values and permitted combinations of values for clinical variables from a CPG. Incomplete clinical data is input into a constraint model and extended to complete CPG solutions for describing a patient state. Modeling a CPG in such a manner can overcome limitations of current guideline models such as missing or mismatched data.
